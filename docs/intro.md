# Introduction

Changing the web3 gaming ecosystem for the better.

## What is Respct?

Respct started off with the famous meme when we played Call Of Duty. **Press F to Pay Respct**

Respct is a multi-chain blockchain gaming ecosystem, there are 4 core offerings, [Respct ID](/profile), [NFT Marketplace](/game), [Community Management](/community) and [Mission Portral](/missions). We aim to help current web3 guilds to manage their communities & make a smooth experience for any gamer to start playing. Gamers don't care about the chain but they care about the gameplay and that is what matters. 

**With Respct, players can play any game on any chain with one login.**

### How does it work?

Respct integrates directly with the biggest gaming studios in the world to bring their assets to NFT Marketplace. Moreover this collaboration allows Respct to integrate [Respct ID](/profile) with the games. With more people using Respct ID, more games will be able to integrate with the Respct Ecosystem and more players will be able to play more games.

All a gamer needs to do is login to Respct with any account they want, connect their non-custodial wallets or create custodial wallets for hastle free gaming experience. Once these wallets are connected, they can start playing games on any chain. Login with Respct ID and start playing! Respct on the backend keeps track of your gameplay & recommends you with the assets that most suite your style of play. You can directly buy these assets from NFT Marketplace without moving your assets on different chains or having to pay for the same.

## Core Offerings

The four core offerings of Respct create the ecosystem for gaming. Our goal is to help game developers to produce the best blockchain game for the community & for gamers to seamlessly play those best games. More than that we also help developers with gameplay, token economics and community management.

#### Respct ID

Respct IDs track gameplay data and allows players to connect multiple wallets to play any game on any chain (NEAR, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos, Ethereum, etc). This ID allows players to prove their gameplay and for any developer to get them onboard without any friction. 

There are multiple ways these IDs can be integrated with games, products or services. 
- It can be integrated with the games themselves as easy as Google Auth.
- It can be integrated with the product or any service using our [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respct-dash). Contact the team if you want to integrate this SDK. We are already working with 5 platforms with our Respct IDs.

#### NFT Marketplace

The biggest problem right now is finding the assets for games and moreover trade those assets to play other game on same or different chain. Guilds have a lot of assets and they are not able to utilize these assets. NFT Marketplace is the solution to this problem. Cross game, multi-chain NFT Markeplace allows for gamers & guilds to buy, sell, lend, borrow assets instantaneously. 

Developers can also use NFT Marketplace to sell their Initial NFT to guilds and players. They can use Respct contracts to integrate the lend & play feature similar to Cyball rather than creating the ecosystem in-house. 

#### Mission Portal

Mission Portal is another product for games launch missions to engage players. For example 
- First 100 players to reach Level 10 get 200 tokens.
- All players who spend more than 30 hours a week in game get 600 tokens.

Completing these missions also help player get more Respct Score attached to their IDs. Developers can reward gamers in tokens, USDC or use $F to reward. 

#### Community Management

Guilds are a huge part of our gaming ecosystem in web2 and web3. These guilds allow gamers to play games and also help developers during INO. They have a huge community scattered over discord which is again really hard to manage. Respct helps them identify top gamers, manage their community and help them to grow their community. 

Respct has guild management & onboarding tools which can remove extensive manpower required to manage or engage with the community. They can manage payout, top players, asset distribution, and more. They can use NFT Marketplace to lend assets which are not in use. They can dalso use our Mission Portal to launch engaging challenges for their community.
